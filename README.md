The Gaming Room was the client and had a game that they were creating called Draw It or Lose It for Android. They were wanting to improve the software functions and expand to other platforms. 

It was helpful to look at having all aspects outlined to start working through the code of the program. It aided in keeping it on target of what was needed for the software to be successful. 

Working to keep the game the same, thinking of the functionalities that the users would like to see and the ease of use on their end will aid in making the client successful in getting the software going. It is important as moving to other platforms, it is needed to encourage those users to want to play the game. 

I tried to focus on having clear documentation and separating the needs for functionality to allow for updates and maintenance to occur.
